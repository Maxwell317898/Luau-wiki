<syntaxhighlight lang="lua" line="1">
local part = script.parent
part:Destroy()
</syntaxhighlight>ok look the part is the script parent 

what we do is the function Destroy (Destroy is a default function) witch will destroy the part and also the script :(

ALSO the function when you are invoking it on a part (eg: script.parent) you must separate the part and the function with a : eg: part:Destroy()

you do not need to do the local part = path.to.part.or.reference you can also just have a game.workspace.part

== MORE ==
ok if you want more then ok here is a list it is just that i recommend you play around with this first <syntaxhighlight lang="lua" line="1">
:Destroy()
:Clone()
:MoveTo -- modals only i think
:move -- depracticated
:ScaleTo
:PivotTo
:GetChidren
:GetPropertyChangedSignal()
:ClearAllChildren()
:FindFirstChild()
-- these are only small portion of all the Methods
</syntaxhighlight>U NEED TO PLAY WITH THESE FISRT IN RBX STUDIO to understand
