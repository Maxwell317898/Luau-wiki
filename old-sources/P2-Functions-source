== '''Structure of Functions''' ==
In this article we will be using this little key system. Take a Look!<syntaxhighlight lang="lua" line="1">
--[[ Our key
vvv The identifier]]
function hello() --<< the call name
    [insert code here] -- main code
end -- end statement
</syntaxhighlight>Ok as we see Here are some basic rules 

The identifier Must Be "function" this shows Roblox that this is a function

The call name Can be anything just make sure it ends with "()" we will get on to the (Test, test) later 

The end statement Must be "end" this just tells roblox to stop

== '''Calling Functions''' ==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua" line="1">
function hello()
    print("hello")
end
hello() 
</syntaxhighlight>Ok when we call a function the function must be above (or Defined) the calling the calling being "hello()" 

as we see "hello()" is defined and is it told to run "print("hello")".  functions run the code thay were told to do you call also call a function more then 1 time 

and the calling the bit at the bottom (line: 4) must match the part in our function in my case line: 1 after the "function" is "hello()". when it is called it Runs the code inside the function (Kinda easy right)

== '''Why use functions?''' ==
We use functions to make our code shorter and not have to re-write all the code instead we use a function

=== Here is some code ===
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua" line="1">
-- my function
function sayhi()
    print("hi")
    if math.random(1, 2) == 1 then
        print("wow i said some text")
    end
end
while true do
    wait(1)
    sayhi()
end

</syntaxhighlight>

== '''Kinda complicated stuff''' ==
Ok as i said in a function you can have something like this "say(What)" for the call name (bit next to "function") Here is the code (this will make this more understandable)<syntaxhighlight lang="lua" line="1">
function say(What)
    print(What)
end
say("Look here is some cool text")
</syntaxhighlight>If we were to run this script in the console it would say   Look here is some cool text    If you understand this already you can skip the rest of this section now just look at this code too<syntaxhighlight lang="lua" line="1">
function say(what, type)
    if type == "w" then
        warn(what)
    else
        print(what)
    end
end
say("cool text", "W")
</syntaxhighlight>When you call or set a call name with double parameters you seperate them with a " , "
